# Introduction

Welcome to introduction to Python!

This three week class will prepare you to read and write basic python scripts.  No prior programming experience required!

# Administrivia

Some homework assignments are from hackerRank.  There are a few reasons for this:

1. Teaches you how to write code that will pass tests.
2. No installation required - you don't need Python locally in order to write code here.
3. Solve real problems.

# Course Breakdown

Assignment for class 2:

For this assignment you will be either creating an account on https://www.pythonanywhere.com
or downloading and installing Python locally.  If at all possible, it is better to install python locally.

But if you are restricted from doing so, PythonAnywhere works.


1. Write a Python program called create_file.py 

The program should create a file called practing_file_writing.txt.  The file should contain the following text:

Hello!  You've successfully created this file with a program!  Congradulations!!!!

2. Write a Python program called edit_file.py

The program should open practicing_file_writing.txt and then add the following line to the end of the file:

Sincerely,
Python

So the whole file should now look like: 

Hello!  You've successfully created this file with a program!  Congradulations!!!!
Sincerely,
Python

The file should then be writen back out as practicing_file_updating.txt.

3. Create a directory called to_traverse and put the file two files created above in the directory.  Then from the directory above to_traverse put a python program called traverse_and_open.py.  This python program should change directories, read both the files into memory and then check if the two files contents are equal.

Week 2


* Introduction to Python Data Structures - Class 1 (class time 30 minutes)
	* lists
	* while loops
	* for loops
	* dictionaries
	* sets

* More file processing - Class 2 (class time 45 minutes)
	* using for loops to read a bunch of text from a file
	* using for loops to write a bunch of text to a file
	* using for loops to move from one directory to the next
	* working with os.walk

Week 3

* Introduction to methods - Class 1 (class time 30 minutes)
	* methods on integers
	* methods on strings
	* methods on lists
	* working with dictionaries

* Making use of methods on strings with files (class time 45 minutes)
	* advanced string processing
	* reading files and processing them as strings in Python
	* traversing directories to look for patterns
	* introduction to very basic regular expressions
